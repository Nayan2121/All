// react list & keys :-

// In React, when rendering a list of elements (such as an array of items), it's important to assign a unique "key" prop to each element.
// The key prop is a special attribute that helps React efficiently update and reorder the elements in the list.

// list & keys example :-

// const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

// const listItems = items.map((item) => {
//     <li key = { item }> { item }</li>)
//     };

// return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;

// In the example above, the key = { item }  assigns the value of each item in the items array as the key for the corresponding list element.



// What is a list in React? :-
// A list in React refers to an array or collection of items that you want to render as components. 
// For example, a list of to-do items, a list of products, or a list of blog posts.


// Why do we need keys? :-
// React uses keys to identify individual elements in a list. 
// Keys help React understand the relationship between the previous and current set of items in the list. 
// They enable React to update the list efficiently by identifying added, removed, or moved items accurately.


// What makes a key unique? :-
// Each key in a list should be unique within the scope of that list. 
// Typically, you use an identifier or a unique property from your data source as the key.


// How to assign keys to list elements? :-
// When rendering a list of elements in React, you need to assign a key prop to each element. 
// You can do this by using the key attribute within the map function.


// Why are unique keys important? :-
// Unique keys help React efficiently update the list when changes occur.
// React uses the keys to determine which elements are added, removed, or reordered.
// Without unique keys, React may have difficulty distinguishing between similar elements, leading to unexpected behavior or degraded performance.
